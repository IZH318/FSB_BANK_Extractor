‚ö†Ô∏è **This FSB/BANK Extractor was created based on the ideas from the `fsb_aud_extr.exe` program provided in a post by id-daemon on the zenhax.com forum: [FMOD FSB files extractor (through their API)](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php@t=1901.html).** <BR> <BR>

This program extracts audio streams from FMOD Sound Bank (.fsb) and Bank (.bank) files and saves them as Waveform Audio (.wav) files. <BR> <BR>

Both Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) versions are provided.

## ‚è© How to Use

**[ ===== FSB_BANK_Extractor_CLI (C++ and C# CLI Versions) ===== ]**

![Ï∫°Ï≤ò_2025_02_19_13_50_51_945](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6eca308-23af-4068-ac3a-75543cc6411f) <BR> <BR>

**1. Run Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell.** <BR> <BR>

**2. Navigate to the directory where the program is located.** <BR> Use the `cd <program_file_path>` command (e.g., `cd D:\tools\FSB_BANK_Extractor`) <BR> <BR>

**3. Execute the program by entering the following command**: <BR>

   - **Basic Usage**: `program.exe <audio_file_path>` <BR>

   - **Usage with Options**: `program.exe <audio_file_path> [Options]` <BR>

       - **‚Äª `program.exe` refers to either the C++ CLI exe file or the C# CLI exe file.** <BR>
           - C++ Version: `FSB_BANK_Extractor_CPP_CLI.exe` <BR>
           - C# Version: `FSB_BANK_Extractor_CS_CLI.exe` <BR> <BR>

   - `<audio_file_path>`: **Required**, enter the path to the FSB or Bank file to be processed. <BR>
     You must enter the **path to the FSB or Bank file**. <BR>
     (* Example: `C:\sounds\music.fsb` or `audio.bank` *) <BR> <BR>

   - `[Options]`: **Optional**, you can selectively use the following options as needed. Add each option after `<audio_file_path>` separated by a space. <BR>
     - `-res`: **Saves WAV files in the same folder as the FSB/Bank file.** (Default option, behaves the same as `-res` if the option is omitted) <BR>
       **Usage Example**: `program.exe audio.fsb -res` (* `-res` option can be omitted, same as `program.exe audio.fsb` *) <BR>

     - `-exe`: **Saves WAV files in the same folder as the program executable file.** <BR>
       **Usage Example**: `program.exe sounds.fsb -exe` <BR>

     - `-o <output_directory>`: **Saves WAV files in the folder specified by the user.**  `<output_directory>` must be the path to the folder where WAV files will be saved. <BR>
       **Usage Example (Absolute Path)**: `program.exe voices.bank -o "C:\output\audio"` <BR>
